All fees related to certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology not otherwise permitted by this section are prohibited from being imposed by a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer. The permitted fees in paragraphs (<abbr title="HL7® SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0">a)(3</abbr>)(ii) and (iv) of this section may include fees that result in a reasonable profit margin in accordance with § 171.302.

<li>While the permitted fees set the boundaries for the fees Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers are permitted to charge and to whom those permitted fees can be charged, they do not prohibit who may pay the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer’s permitted fee. In other words, these conditions limit the party from which a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer may require payment, but they do not speak to who may pay the fee.</li>
<li>Fees charged for “value-added services” can arise between an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source and Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer or <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> User.</li>
<li>Our goal with the requirement that fees be “objective and verifiable” is to require Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers to apply fee criteria that, among other things, will lead the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer to come to the same conclusion with respect to the permitted fee’s amount each time it administers a fee to an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source or <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> User.

<li>Any fee for access to the documentation that a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer is required to publish or make available under this Condition of Certification requirement.</li>
<li>Any fee for access to other types of documentation or information that a software developer may reasonably require to make effective use of certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology for any legally permissible purpose.</li>
<li>Any fee in connection with any services that would be essential to a developer or other person’s ability to develop and commercially distribute production-ready applications that use certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology. These services could include, for example, access to “test environments” and other resources that an application developer would need to efficiently design and develop apps. The services could also include access to distribution channels if they are necessary to deploy production-ready software and to production resources, such as the information needed to connect to certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology (e.g., service base URLs) or the ability to dynamically register with an authorization server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fees for requirements beyond what a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer considers necessary to successfully deploy applications in production are considered supplemental to the development, testing, and deployment of software applications that interact with certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology, and can be classified as permitted fees for value-added services as finalized in § <abbr title="API Conditions and Maintenance of certification requirements that apply to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(7) - (10)">170.404</abbr>(<abbr title="HL7® SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0">a)(3</abbr>)(iv).</li>

<li>“Usage-based” fees are fees imposed by a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer to recover costs typically incurred for supporting <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> interactions at increasing volumes and scale within established service levels. That is, “usage-based” fees recover costs incurred by a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer due to the actual use of the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology once it has been deployed (e.g., costs to support a higher volume of traffic, data, or number of apps via the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology).</li>
<li>A Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer's “incremental costs” comprise the Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer's costs that are directly attributable to supporting <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> interactions at increasing volumes and scale within established service levels.</li>

In scenarios where the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source, such as a large hospital system, assumes full responsibility for the technical infrastructure necessary to deploy and host the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> technology it has acquired, the volume and scale of its usage would be the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source’s sole responsibility, and a Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer would not be permitted to charge usage-based fees.</li>
<li>The costs recovered under “usage-based” fees can only reflect “post-deployment” costs.

<li>Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers must make available appropriately scoped service base URLs that can be used by patients to access their EHI for Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>).</li>
<li>As discussed in section VIII.C.6.c of the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> <abbr title="21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program">Cures Act Final Rule</abbr>, <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sources who locally manage their Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (<abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr>) servers without Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developer assistance cannot refuse to provide to Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers the <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> service base URL(s) that is/are necessary for patients to use to access their EHI. Equally, pursuant to this Maintenance of Certification requirement, they would be required to publish the <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> service base URLs they centrally manage on behalf of <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sources.</li>
<li>To be open and transparent to the public, developers must provide a hyperlink to the list of service base URLs to be published with the product on the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL). Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers are encouraged to use a standardized format when publishing the service base URLs for all of its customers. <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> recommends Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers leverage the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/endpoint.html" target="_blank"><abbr title="Health Level 7">HL7</abbr> <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> 4.0.1 “Endpoint” resource</a>, or profiles of this resource such as the Validated Healthcare Directory Implementation Guide STU1 <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/vhdir/2018Jan/StructureDefinition-vhdir-endpoint.html" target="_blank">“vhdir-endpoint” profile</a>, to represent service base URLs that can be used by patients to access their health information. <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> also encourages developers to provide as much information about the service base URLs as available, including the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source’s organization details, such as name, location, and provider identifiers (e.g., NPI, CCN, or health system ID). These steps will help industry coalesce around standards that enable application developers to more easily and consistently provide patients access to their electronic health information.</li>

<details class="question"><summary>Why is this requirement only applicable to Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers with health IT certified to § 170.315(<abbr title="Standardized HL7® FHIR-based API certification criterion">g)(10</abbr>) and only for publishing Service Base URLs for patient-facing <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> and not any others, including Bulk Data Access <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>?</summary><ul>
<li>The regulatory requirement is a result of both a proposed provision (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2019-02224/page-7494">84 FR 7494</a>; see also <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2019-02224/page-7483">84 FR 7483</a>) and the consideration of public comments on the proposal with consideration given the benefits and burden of the requirement and alternative means to achieve <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr>'s policy goals (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/page-25764">85 FR 25764-25765</a>).</li>
<li>To facilitate patients’ access to their health information, <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> proposed requirements for Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers to publish <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> Service Base URLs to “…allow health information from [<abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>] to be accessed, exchanged, and used without special effort…including providing access to all data elements of <strong>a patient’s</strong> electronic health record…” (emphasis added) (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2019-02224/page-7494">84 FR 7494</a>)</li>
<li><abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> did not propose that health IT developers publicly publish <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> for multiple patient services in the <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> Cures Act Proposed Rule. After consideration of public comments and alternative means to achieve <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr>’s policy goals, <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> did not finalize an expanded requirement to publish all service base URLs.  Below are the additional reasons for this decision: <ul>
<li><abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> acknowledged that stakeholders expressed concern about Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers publishing client service base URLs (e.g., obtaining consent from the health care provider).</li>
<li>The <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> <abbr title="21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program">Cures Act Final Rule</abbr> gives <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sources (e.g., health care organizations) the independent ability to permit <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Users (e.g., third party application developers) to interact with the certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Technology deployed by an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-D/part-170#p-170.404(a)(4)">45 <abbr title="Code of Federal Regulations">CFR</abbr> <abbr title="API Conditions and Maintenance of certification requirements that apply to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(7) - (10)">170.404</abbr>(a)(4)</a>).</li>
<li>In instances where a business associate agreement under the HIPAA regulations is required, <abbr title="Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT">ONC</abbr> anticipates that the Service Base URLs targeted for provider-facing applications will be shared with provider-facing application developers (business associates) by the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sources (covered entities) (see, for example, <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/page-25764">85 FR 25764</a>, “We anticipate that an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Source (e.g., a health care organization) that is a HIPAA covered entity would vet and enter into a HIPAA business associate agreement with a provider-facing application developer prior to using the application within their internal technical enterprise”).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Information Sources (e.g., health care providers) and Certified <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> Developers (health IT developers of certified health IT) may implicate the information blocking regulations if they did not make available Service Base URLs (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/page-25765">85 FR 25765</a>.) Specifically, we stated in the <abbr title="21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program">Cures Act Final Rule</abbr> that “…A <abbr title="HL7® Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources">FHIR</abbr> service base URL cannot be withheld by an actor [health care providers, health IT developers of certified health IT, and HINs/HIEs] as it (just like many other technical interfaces) is necessary to enable the access, exchange, and use of EHI.” (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/page-25813">85 FR 25813</a>).</li>
